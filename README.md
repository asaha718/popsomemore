# Proposal for POP Some MORE

## Background:
Pop some more will be an arcade style web game that allows players to shoot down a balloon that doubles as you pop it. Players will generate points for shooting down bubbles and can level through the game. Reminds me of a game I used to play as a kid but can not find on the web anymore. 

## Functionality: 
* Player will be able to move left and right 
* Will be able to shoot projectile at balloon
* Ballon will reduce in size and multiply when struck 
* Modal to explain rules of game

## Technologies used: 
* Javascript 
* Canvas
* Github pages 

## Timeline: 
* Day 1- Learning canvas and get canvas set up with shapes needed for game 
* Day 2- Physics of game. Get balloons to fall from the starting position, and the collision balloon should double. 
* Day 3- Game over and leveling logic 
* Day 4- Styling game
